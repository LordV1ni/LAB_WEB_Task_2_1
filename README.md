Sample node express 5 application
---------------------------------

This application uses ES modules, nunjucks as template engine and swagger for documenting the API.
It is derived from the code generated by express-generator and heavily modernized.

This version includes 
* POST
* schema validation und sanitation with JSON-schema using Ajv
* reading from and writing to a MongoDB
* Authentication and authorization with Passport.js
* Test with supertest

Create a .env file in the root of your project containing at  least MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/joke" to connect 
to local MongoDB, to a string directing to your database 
e.g. "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster...mongodb.net/joke?appName=abc",
or set this environment variable manually e.g. in Webstorm in "run - edit configurations" or 
where your cloud provider lets you do it. You should *never* commit .env to a repository.

Please note that in a real project you should use dotenvx instead of dotenv https://dotenvx.com/
